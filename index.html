      <h3> FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE NFL </h3>
      <p>
          Did you know that the mascot for the now Las Vegas Raiders, Raider Rusher, originally was
          inspired by a cartoon series titled "NFL Rush Zone" that was co-produced by the NFL and
          Nickelodeon? Or that the NFL as we know it today has technically only been around since
          June 8th, 1966 when the AFL-NFL merger happened? This merger brought us the very first Super
          Bowl on January 15th, 1967. Find out more interesting information, past and current,
          about the NFL and all 32 teams by checking out some of the content below.
